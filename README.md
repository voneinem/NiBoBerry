# NiBoBerry
Fun with NIBObee Berry (nicai systems)

I just got my [BIBObee Berry](http://www.nicai-systems.com/en/robotics/nibobee/berry) up and running.
Now I'm going to share my stuff here for anybody that might be interested.

## Projects

### Simple serial communication 

[ledserial.py](./ledserial.py)

This script allows to send commands and receive replys from RPi to NIBObee.

More about the serial protocol [here](http://www.nibo-roboter.de/wiki/Nibo_Serial_Protocol).

### Next step is to provide a nice python API for the NIBObee sensors and actors.
